DFS Client

NAME
    Client -- Distributed File System Client / User Interface


SYNOPSIS
    Client controller-host controller-port command [command_arguments]


DESCRIPTION
    The Client communicates with the controller and storage nodes (to
    upload and download chunks of files). It is the part of the
    Distributed File System (DFS) that allows user interaction.

    list-storage-nodes
        Lists all the storage nodes seen by the controller.

    list-files
        Retrieves the names of the files reachable by the controller.

    list-filenames
    ls
        A shorter version of list-files that only outputs filenames,
        just like the "ls" command.

    download-file filename
        Downloads a file from the DFS.
        In detail, it will query the controller about the location of
        the chunks, download those from different storage nodes
        in parallel, calculate the checksum, and finally assemble them
        into a single file.

    upload-file filename
        Uploads a file to the DFS.
        In detail, it will chunk the file into several pieces,
        calculate a checksum for each "chunk" and send those chunks
        in parallel to a list of storage nodes provided by the controller
        to store the file.

     delete-file filename
        Removes file from DFS.
